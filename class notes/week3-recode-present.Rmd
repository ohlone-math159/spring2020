## Knitr Options

```{r setup, include=T}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

  >- `echo` = **TRUE** tells Knit operation to show code along with output for all chunks

## Library Command

```{r, message=FALSE, warning= F}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

  >- loads in the `tidyverse` and `janitor` packages

## Getting the data file into the R environment

An easy trick is to click on the data and look in the `Console` for the proper function notation.
```{r}
load("~/R/spring2020/data/addhealth4.RData")
```


## Trimming your data file to just the variables you want 

```{r}
mydata_raw <- addhealth4 %>% 
  select(H4ID1)
```

  >- we just selected a single variable `H4ID1` and placed it into the dataframe `mydata_raw`

## `gimpse` the new dataframe

```{r}
glimpse(mydata_raw)
```

## Looking at Codebook for `H4ID1`

![](~/R/spring2020/hw/images/H4ID1 -health_limits_act.png)


## Mutate and Recoding Functions

```{r}
mydata_c <- mydata_raw %>% 
  mutate(health_limit_activity = recode_factor(H4ID1,
                             "1"="not limited",
                             "2"="limited a little",
                             "3"="limited a lot",
                             "8"="don't know",
                             .ordered=T))
                              
```

## Checking the accuracy of your work - Option 1

```{r}
mydata_c %>% 
  tabyl(H4ID1,health_limit_activity)
```

## Checking the accuracy of your work - Option 2

```{r}
mydata_c %>% 
  tabyl(health_limit_activity) %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits=1)
```
