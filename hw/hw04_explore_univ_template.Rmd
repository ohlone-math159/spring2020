# Table of Variables

Original Variable  |   New Variable  |    Description
-------------------|-----------------|------------------
RACE  |  race_c  | subject's race
BIO_SEX4 | gender | subject's gender
--  |  age | subject's age
H4ED2 | college_deg | Dd you complete college (bachelor's degree)?

The participants in the **addhealth** study were asked, "*In the past 24 hours, have you participated in vigorous physical activity long enough to work up a sweat, get your heart thumping, or get out of breath?*" **5111** out of **5114** provided a "yes" or "no" response, with approximately **40%** of the participant responding **yes**.  Approximately **2 out of 5** participants have participated in a vigorous activity in the past 24 hours.

# Examining numerical variable 
## 1st Numerical `hrs_work_week`

**Numerical Summary Table** 

```{r summarize num 1}

**Histogram - visualization of the distribution**

```{r hist num 1}

    geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), color="white", fill="steelblue", binwidth = 5) + 
      xlab("hours per week") +
      ggtitle("How many hours a week (do/did) you usually work at this job?") 
```

**Boxplot - visualization of 5 number summary**

```{r boxplot num 1}

**Narrative Summary**
<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">

Participants were asked, in reference to their curren or most recent job (which they work more than 10 hours/week), "*How many hours a week (do/did) you usually work at this job?*"  

* **5023** out of **5114** responded with hours between 10 and 120.  
  
* **82** participants were a **legitimate skip** since they have not worked a paying job for at least 10 hours a week, they are not represented here.  

The center of the distribution is best described with the **mode** and **median** of 40 hours/week.   There is considerable overall variation as hours vary from 10 to 120, although the middle 50% of particpants are between 40 and 45 hours, for an interquartile range (**IQR**) of 5 hours.  Weekly work hours is *slightly skewed to the **right*** (since outliers extend, to the right, to 120 hours).  This skew also results in the **mean** being greater than the **median**, which is a typically characteristic of right skewed distributions.
