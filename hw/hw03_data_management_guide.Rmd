# Assignment Overview

By now you should know what variables you want to use, and you've looked over the codebook enough now that you have an idea of some potential problems that you will encounter. This assignment uses your chosen research data, and the variables that you chose in the last assignment when you created a personal research codebook. You will thoughtfully review the variables you are interested in, document which ones will need changed and how. 

All raw data needs to stay raw, and all changes need to be documented. You will create a script/code file that will make all changes to the data in a programatically and reproducible way. You will create a single code file that imports your raw data, performs some data cleaning steps, and saves out an analysis ready data set that you will use throughout the semester. 

You are **not** expected to have completed data management for every one of your variables under consideration by the submission date. 

# Instructions 

1. `Save As` the `template.Rmd` so a new file is created with your name in it.
 
2.  Library the `dplyr` and `janitor` packages

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
```

3.  Load in your data.

Load in your raw data file - with `load` command for the `addhealth4` data
```{r}
load("~/R/spring2020/data/addhealth4.RData")
```

4. Use the `select` function from `dplyr` package to select the variables from your codebook (**HW02**).  As you select your variables put this selection into a new data frame called `mydata`. (Later you might need to add variable to your selection, which will just require you to modify and run this `Rmd`)

```{r}
mydata <- addhealth4 %>% 
  select(RACE, BIO_SEX4, iyear4, h4od1y , H4GH1, H4GH7, H4GH8, H4MH2, H4MH7, H4MH9, H4MH22, H4MH23, H4MH24, H4MH25, H4DA11 )
```

5. Check each variable for necessary adjustments. Complete each of the following steps for each variable.
    - First explain in english what the variable name is and what it measures. 
    - Then examine the variable using the `freq` function in the `descr` package. 
    - Identify the data type of the variable using `class`. Does this match with the intended data type? 
    - Recode the data as necessary (See section 1.4 in the course packet)
    - Always confirm your recodes worked as intended by creating another table or summary. 

## Example 1 -`RACE` variable.
Checking the Codebook
![](images/race.png)

Let's look at the `RACE` variable using two methods

```{r}
glimpse(mydata)
```

We can see that `RACE` is coded with numbers 1 through 6. Replacing the coded numbers with the actual labels will make future analysis easier to understand.  

We will use the `recode_factor` function from `dplyr` to accomplish this *replacement* (**i.e., recoding**) task.
```{r}
mydata_c <- mydata %>% 
  mutate(race_c = recode_factor(RACE,
                                "5"="white",
                                "2"="black",
                                "4"="asian_pacific_islander",
                                "3"="native_american",
                                "1"="multiple_races",
                                "6"="other",
                                .ordered=T))
```

You should always confirm that your function did as intended.  You can check by comparing the two variables

```{r}
mydata_c %>% 
  select(RACE, race_c)
```

Another check is do the percentage in the codebook match your new variable.

```{r}
mydata_c %>% 
  tabyl(race_c) %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits=2)
```

## Example 2 - H4DA11 
Checking the codebook  
![](images/vigorous_24h.png)

We'll do the same process.  In addition we'll choose a new varaible name so we don't need to remember what `H4DA11` means.

**Note - this time I am working off my new data frame `mydata_c`

```{r}
mydata_c <- mydata_c %>% 
  mutate(vigorous_activity = recode_factor(H4DA11,
                                "0"="no",
                                "1"="yes",
                                "6"="refused",
                                "8"="don't know",
                                .ordered=T))
```

Check
```{r}
mydata_c %>% 
  select(H4DA11, vigorous_activity)
```

```{r}
mydata_c %>% 
  tabyl(vigorous_activity) %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits=2)
```

```{r}
mydata_c %>% 
  tabyl(H4DA11) %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits=2)
```

6. Remove the variables that you modified, so you only have the version of the variables that you want in your data frame.

    - Similar to how you trimmed down `raw` into `mydata`, now you want to only keep the variables that you want to save into your analysis data set. 
    - e.g. I only want to keep the categorical version of `health`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
clean <- mydata %>% select(age, marital, cesd, health_cat)
```

8. Save the resulting data set to your `data` folder as `datasetname_clean.Rdata` e.g. `addhealth_clean.Rdata`. 
    - This will serve as your analysis data set to do all your subsequent assignments on. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
save(clean, file="depression_clean.Rdata")
```

# Example

The variable `health` records a persons perceived general health as being either Excellent, Good, Fair or Poor. This is considered an ordinal categorical variable. 

```{r}
freq(mydata$health)
class(mydata$health)
```

The variable `health` currently is an integer with numeric values 1-4, but the codebook states that this is a categorical variable where 1=Excellent, 2=Good, 3=Fair, 4=Poor. 
So I need to convert this numeric variable to a factor variable. There are no values outside the 1-4 range, such as a -9 that codes for missing data so I do not need to make any further adjustments (You want to code out missing before you convert variables to factors)

```{r}
mydata$health_cat <- factor(mydata$health, labels=c("Excellent", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))
```

I will confirm that the recode worked by making a two-way `table`
```{r}
table(mydata$health, mydata$health_cat, useNA="always")
```
This shows that all 1's are now 'excellent', 4's are now 'poor' and so forth. 


## Example 2

Here is an example data management file for the Add Health data: https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/data/dm_addhlth.html as an example. _Warning, do not copy this code from the HTML file directly. It will contain special characters that will prevent your code from working. Plus the sleep variable didn't quite work the way we intended._ 


# Submission instructions

This is an individual assignment using your project data

Upload your <span style="color:red">RMD code</span> file only to the **hw03 Data Management** folder in Google Drive. 
  
* I will download this file and run it on my computer.
* It must run for credit. If it compiles to PDF for you then this should be no problem for me.
