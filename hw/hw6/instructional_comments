Tuesday Update

I am pretty happy with a first day (introduction) of sampling.

Wrote an Rmd introduction to sampling and sampling distribution.

Made it interactive with prompts.  (not requiring any coding for the introduction)

Plan to just go over and have student go into breakouts of 4 to discuss each prompts 

Not set on technology for students to share responses.  Think first they discuss in groups / maybe share in group chat in breakout / and then when back groups volunteer to share ideas? / also was thinking I want them to enter something archival that I can use to provide motivation and a grade component for participation?  (not sure - maybe a group discussion in Canvas for some questions?  or Google Form?  - want something easy...)  Like for instance on these 6 questions - I would like the final question number 6 to be the one that they get credit for answering?

1-2
3
4
5
6


Thinking ahead (quick thoughts...)
Next activity - would be for groups to recreate the Sampling Distribution for additional sample sizes of 100 and 200?  (and answer questions regarding what they are seeing)  --- Probably outside of class --- come together to discuss prompts?

Next activity - use of summary statistics for sample distributions to better understand sampling variation (intro in class - they then apply to 100 and 200 sample sizes)

Next activity - confidence intervals

Wrap-Up - Individual project - give them a larger population ( or 4 different samples of different sample size?)  to sample and construct CI and sampling distributions and assess understanding in a new context...

Next activity - sample from their data to construct a confidence interval (maybe or maybe not?)

How does this lay out into days?  Don't know yet?  What do I ask them to do outside of class and what inside of class?  Don't know for sure...

I'm thinking this will take 2 weeks time with the wrap-up activity being started on week 2 .
