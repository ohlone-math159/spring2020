# Exercises for Chapter 2: Causal Effects
## Exercises in DSS
1. [Efficacy of Small-class Size in Early Education](small-class-size) (Thanks to [Elisha Cohen](https://github.com/ecohen13))
   * *Summary*: Is there a causal effect of small class sizes on educational performance? This exercise provides an introduction to measuring treatment effects in randomized experiments.

   * *Sections of DSS*: 2.2, 2.4, 2.5
2. [Changing Minds on Gay Marriage](gay-marriage) (Thanks to [James Lo](https://github.com/jameslo989))
   * *Summary*: Can a simple conversation change someone's mind on social issues? Students will analyze data from a randomized canvassing experiment to get first-hand experience finding treatment effects, relational operators, and more.

   * *Sections of DSS*: 2.2, 2.4, 2.5
3. [Success of Leader Assassination as a Natural Experiment](leader-assassination)
   * *Summary*: This exercise considers a natural experiment in which the success or failure of assassination attempts is assumed to be essentially random. This provides students with an opportunity to analyze data from an observational study and practice computing the difference-in-means estimator, custom variables, and other basic R commands.

   * *Sections of DSS*: 2.4, 2.5

## Additional exercises
1. [Effect of Demographic Change on Exclusionary Attitudes](exclusionary-attitudes) (Thanks to [Elisha Cohen](https://github.com/ecohen13))
   * *Summary*: The study used in this exercise assessed the extent to which views can be affected by exposure to demographic change. Students will get more practice estimating treatment effects.

   * *Sections of DSS*: 2.4, 2.5
2. [Health Savings Experiment](health-savings) (Thanks to [Yo-Yo Chen](https://github.com/shuangyoyo))
   * *Summary*: What are the some of the key barriers to saving for poor people? Students will use data from a field experiment to estimate various treatment effects to work towards an answer, getting plenty of practice calculating difference-in-means estimators for several groups simultaneously along the way.

3. [Co-ethnic Voting in Africa](ethnic-voting) (Thanks to [Adeline Lo](https://github.com/adelinelo))
   * *Summary*: Can politicians leverage their spouse's ethnicity for an electoral advantage? Students will analyze and compare various groups in a dataset from this study.
