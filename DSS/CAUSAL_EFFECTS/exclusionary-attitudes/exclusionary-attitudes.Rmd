A researcher conducted a randomized field experiment assessing the
extent to which individuals living in suburban communities around
Boston, Massachusetts, and their views were affected by exposure to
demographic change. 

This exercise is based on: Enos, R. D. 2014. “[Causal Effect of 
Intergroup Contact on Exclusionary 
Attitudes.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1317670111)”

## Question 1

The benefit of randomly assigning individuals to the treatment
  or control groups is that the two groups should be similar, on
  average, in terms of their covariates. This is referred to as
  'covariate balance.' Show that the treatment and control groups
  are balanced by comparing the proportions of gender
  (`male`), ethnicity (`white`), attendance of college (`college`), 
  and US birth status (`usborn`) 
  in the treatment and control groups. Provide a brief 
  interpretation of the results.

## Answer 1

```{r}
## load data
boston <- read.csv("data/boston.csv", head = TRUE)
## compute proportions for male
mean(boston$male[boston$treatment == 1])
mean(boston$male[boston$treatment == 0])
## compute proportions for white
mean(boston$white[boston$treatment == 1])
mean(boston$white[boston$treatment == 0])
## compute proportions for college
mean(boston$college[boston$treatment == 1])
mean(boston$college[boston$treatment == 0])
## compute proportions for usborn
mean(boston$usborn[boston$treatment == 1])
mean(boston$usborn[boston$treatment == 0])
```
    
Proportions for all covariates across the treatment
and control groups are relatively similar; 
this is the footprint of successful random assignment.

## Question 2
      
Individuals in the experiment were asked a series of questions
  both at the beginning and the end of the experiment. One such
  question was "Do you think the number of immigrants from Mexico who
  are permitted to come to the United States to live should be
  increased, left the same, or decreased?" The response to this
  question prior to the experiment is in the variable
  `numberim.pre`. The response to this question after the
  experiment is in the variable `numberim.post`. In both cases
  the variable is coded on a 1 -- 5 scale. Responses with values of 1
  are inclusionary ('pro-immigration') and responses with values of
  5 are exclusionary ('anti-immigration').  Compute the average
  treatment effect on the change in attitudes about immigration. That
  is, how does the mean change in attitudes about immigration policy
  for those in the control group compare to those in the treatment
  group. Interpret the result.

## Answer 2

```{r}
## compute change in attitude
boston$change <- boston$numberim.post - boston$numberim.pre
treat.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 1],
                     na.rm = TRUE)
ctrl.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 0],
                    na.rm = TRUE)
treat.change
ctrl.change
## average treatment effect
treat.change - ctrl.change
```
    
The average change within the control group is a decrease in
`r round(ctrl.change*-1, 2)` points on the 5 point scale (where a decrease
indicates more inclusionary attitudes). The average change within the
treatment group is an increase in `r round(treat.change, 2)` points on the 5
point scale (where an increase indicates more exclusionary
attitudes). The average treatment effect is the difference of the
two. On average, the responses of individuals in the treatment group
were more exclusionary than the control group by
`r round(treat.change - ctrl.change,2)` points. Exposure to
simulated demographic changes caused this increase in exclusionary
attitudes.

## Question 3

Does having attended college influence the effect of being
  exposed to 'outsiders' on exclusionary attitudes? Another way to
  ask the same question is this: is there evidence of a differential
  impact of treatment, conditional on attending college versus not
  attending college?  Calculate the necessary quantities to answer
  this question and interpret the results. Consider the average
  treatment effect for those who attended college and then those who
  did not. **Hint:** To help determine the conditional impact of 
  treatment, consider using the logical operator `&`. `&` can be used to add
  more criteria to a logical test, e.g., `variable.one == 1 & variable.two == 2`
  is a test that can only be "passed" with a value of `TRUE` if 
  both $variable.one = 1$ *and* $variable.two = 2$.

## Answer 3

```{r}
t.col.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 1 & boston$college == 1], na.rm = TRUE)
c.col.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 0 & boston$college == 1], na.rm = TRUE)
t.nocol.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 1 & boston$college == 0], na.rm = TRUE)
c.nocol.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 0 & boston$college == 0], na.rm = TRUE)
ate.col <- t.col.change - c.col.change
ate.nocol <- t.nocol.change - c.nocol.change
ate.col
ate.nocol
ate.col - ate.nocol
```
    
The average treatment effect (using the 'change' variable) among
those with a college education is an increase in exclusionary
attitudes of about `r round(ate.col,2)` points. Among those
without a college education, there is an increase in exclusionary
attitudes of about `r round(ate.nocol,2)`. Both of these effects
are on a 5 point scale.

The difference between them is less than `r round(ate.col -
  ate.nocol,2)` points on this scale and is negligible. Because the
average treatment effects do not vary across the two subgroups, there
is no evidence of a differential impact.

## Question 4

Repeat the same analysis as in the previous question but this
  time with respect to ideology. Compute the
  average treatment effect for each value of the 
  `ideology` variable.  What patterns do you
  observe?  Give a brief substantive interpretation of the results. 
    
## Answer 4

```{r}
## treatment group change by ideology
ideo1.trt.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 1 & boston$ideology == 1], na.rm = TRUE)
ideo2.trt.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 1 & boston$ideology == 2], na.rm = TRUE)
ideo3.trt.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 1 & boston$ideology == 3], na.rm = TRUE)
ideo4.trt.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 1 & boston$ideology == 4], na.rm = TRUE)
ideo5.trt.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 1 & boston$ideology == 5], na.rm = TRUE)
## control group change by ideology
ideo1.ctrl.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 0 & boston$ideology == 1], na.rm = TRUE)
ideo2.ctrl.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 0 & boston$ideology == 2], na.rm = TRUE)
ideo3.ctrl.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 0 & boston$ideology == 3], na.rm = TRUE)
ideo4.ctrl.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 0 & boston$ideology == 4], na.rm = TRUE)
ideo5.ctrl.change <- mean(boston$change[boston$treatment == 0 & boston$ideology == 5], na.rm = TRUE)
## treatment effect by ideology
ideo1.trt.change - ideo1.ctrl.change
ideo2.trt.change - ideo2.ctrl.change
ideo3.trt.change - ideo3.ctrl.change
ideo4.trt.change - ideo4.ctrl.change
ideo5.trt.change - ideo5.ctrl.change
```
    
Within each ideology category, we see the largest
changes between treatment and control groups at the extremes of the
distribution. We also see a fair amount of difference in treatment
effects, suggesting there may be a differential impact by age and by
ideology.
